### Hi there üëã 

I'm a software developer üíª with a background in experimental nuclear physics :atom:. My interest lies in tools :wrench: to improve productivity :chart_with_upwards_trend: and scientific insight :telescope:, including rich documentation üìö, interactive computing üßÆ, and more! 

I have experience in many aspects of software engineering, including game design, full-stack web development, and high-performance numeric computing. My main focus at Princeton is on the [Awkward Array project](awkward-array.org/), which describes itself as a library that can 
> manipulate JSON-like data with NumPy-like idioms.
