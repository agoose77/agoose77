### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a software developer ðŸ’» with a background in experimental nuclear physics :atom:. My interest lies in tools :wrench: to improve productivity :chart_with_upwards_trend: and scientific insight :telescope:, including rich documentation ðŸ“š, interactive computing ðŸ§®, and more! 

I have experience in many aspects of software engineering, including game design, full-stack web development, and high-performance numeric computing. 

At 2i2c I wok as an Open Source Applications Engineer on [MyST](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd) community building, tooling, and the wider ecosystem. 

My main focus at Princeton was on the [Awkward Array project](awkward-array.org/), a library that makes it possible to 
> manipulate JSON-like data with NumPy-like idioms.

> I remain an active maintainer of the project.
